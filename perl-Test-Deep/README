perl-Test-Deep is required for building some of the RPM's used for other
TUSK add-ons. It can be confusing to install becuase it's available from the "rpmforge-extras" repository, which needs this:

    yum install --enablerepo=rpmforge-extras perl-Test-Deep

For building RPM's that require perl-Test-Deep with mock, see the
directions in ../mock.
