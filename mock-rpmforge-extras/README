Use "mock" to build these RPM packages from the sources. mock is
available from EPEL, and builds RPM packages in a minimally configured
chroot cage so that they are built consistently and without local
modificatons to a buld system interfering with building clean packages.

These are /etc/mock files that include the "rpmforge" and
"rpmforge-extras" repositories. They're needed to build certain perl
modules for TUSK with mock, particularly perl-HTML-Mason, which
requires the 'perl(Test::Deep)' module for testing.

Install mock and put these files in place to allow mock to build such
components.

	sudo yum install mock
	usermod -a -G mock 'youraccount'

	# Then log out, and back in, to get the "mock group permissions

	# Test basic mock operation
	mock init
	# Install the custom config files
	sudo cp rpmforge*cfg /etc/mock
	# Test the custom repo
	mock -r rpmforge-extras-5-i386 init
