The MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession Perl module is used by TUSK.
It is not yet available in RPEL or RPMforge.

It has significant build dependencies on other components not yet in
EPSL or RPMforge, including:

    perl(HTML::Mason)

The .spec file is easily compiled with the "cpanspec" tool and those
dependencies already installed locally.
