cpan2rpm is an old, and very helpful, tool for building RPM's from
CPAN perl modules. It uses the standard RPM file structure and creates
a spec file, a source RPM, and a binary, leaving these in their
respective directories.

The modified cpan2rpm.spec file adds some missing dependencies, for
tools like perl-libwww-perl, perl(ExtUtils::MakeMaker), and fakeroot.
It's also been modified with INSTALLDIRS=vendor set to get
installations in /usr instead of /usr/local for recent perl releases.

To build with cpan2rpm itself, and the patches included use this.

   cpan2rpm cpan2rpm-2.028.tar.gz  \
   	    --patch=$PWD/cpan2rpm-2.028-vendor.patch \
	    --patch=$PWD/cpan2rpm-2.028-pod-text.patch
