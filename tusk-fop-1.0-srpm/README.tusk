This configuration of fop is built from binary packaging, becuase
compilation under RHEL 5 and 6 is infeasible without a lot of other
Java utilities installed. It's also installed only in
"/usr/local/tusk-version" and is accessible as "/usr/local/fop/fop",
not the normal RHEL location of "/usr/bin/fop.

This configuration also has TUSKS specific configuration files,
visible in /usr/local/fop/conf.
